## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-23

Initial public release. See [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for
the full announcement.

### Added

- Initial scaffold: `Client`, options, canonical error kinds, environments.
- `src/transport/` with envelope unwrap, redaction, retry, and
  observability hooks.
- `src/auth/` with Business OTP and SEP-10 flows, `TokenStore`
  interface, `MemoryStore`, and single-flight autorefresh.
- `src/stellar/` narrow wrapper exposing `Keypair`, `Signer`, and `Asset`.
- `src/client/` sub-packages for health, business, application,
  connect, payments, and reports.
- `src/recipes/` package: `loginOTP`, `registerApplication`,
  `connectLogin`, `connectPayment` (9-step off-ramp),
  `rotateCredential`, and `quoteThenExecute`.
- `src/webhook/` package with HMAC verification, constant-time
  comparison, clock-skew bounds, and replay cache.
- Example programs under `examples/`.
- MkDocs documentation scaffold under `docs/`.

### Security

- Default `TokenStore` is memory-only; persistence requires an explicit
  insecure opt-in.
- Redactor strips bearer tokens, `x-zeam-auth`, `Set-Cookie`, JWTs, and
  Stellar seed / public key patterns before any user-supplied logger
  sees them.
- `client/connect.exec` rejects absolute URIs and restricts the path
  regex to guard against SSRF abuse.
